 * \anchor xrThread
 * \brief Cooperative multi-threading support.
 *
 * Typically Nut/OS is at its most useful where there are several
 * concurrent tasks that need to be undertaken at the same time.
 * To support this requirement, Nut/OS offers some kind of light
 * processes called threads. In this context a thread is a sequence
 * of executing software that can be considered to be logically
 * independent from other software that is running on the same CPU.
 *
 * All threads are executing in the same address space using the
 * same hardware resources, which significantly reduces task switching
 * overhead. Therefore it is important to stop them from causing
 * each other problems. This is particularly an issue where two or
 * more threads need to share a resources like memory locations or
 * peripheral devices.
 *
 * The system works on the principle that the most urgent thread
 * always runs. One exception to this is if a CPU interrupt arrives
 * and the interrupt has not been disabled. Each thread has a
 * priority which is used to determine how urgent it is. This
 * priority ranges from 0 to 255, with the lowest value indicating
 * the most urgent.
 *
 * Nut/OS implements cooperative multithreading. That means,
 * that threads are not bound to a fixed timeslice. Unless
 * they are waiting for specific event or explicitly yielding
 * the CPU, they can rely on not being stopped unexpectedly.
 * However, they may be interrupted by hardware interrupt
 * signals. In opposite to pre-emptive multithreading,
 * cooperative multithreading simplifies resource sharing
 * and results in faster and smaller code.
 *
 * \todo Using the special priority 255 to kill a thread is not
 * required and should be removed.
 *
 * To specify a function named Back as an independent thread, one can write
 * \code
 * #include <sys/thread.h>
 *
 * THREAD(Back, arg)
 * {
 *     for (;;) {
 *         NutSleep(1000);
 *     }
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * To start this thread, use
 * \code
 * #include <sys/thread.h>
 *
 * // Other code here...
 * NutThreadCreate("Bg", Back, NULL, 512);
 * // Execution continues here and concurrently in the background thread.
 * \endcode
 *
 * The functions listed below are hardware independent. Additional
 * API calls are located in the architecture dependant sections.
 * - \ref xgNutArchAvrOsContextGcc "AVR with GNU Compiler"
