 * \brief System tick counter.
 *
 * For the time being we put this here to ensure that it will be placed
 * in lower RAM. This is essential for the AVR platform, where we use
 * this counter to determine the system clock and calculate the correct
 * baudrate factors. If this counter would be placed in external RAM,
 * additional wait states may apply.
 *
 * \todo To be removed.
