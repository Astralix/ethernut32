When executing 'make install' in any application directory, then
the resulting binaries are copied to here. In fact, two binaries
are created for each application. One with the extension .hex
contains Intel Hex Code and can be used by most programmers. The
other one with the extension .bin contains a binary image to be
used for tftp upload as well as SAM-BA and SAM-PROG.
