F1 has fixed remapping, pins are remapped in groups. With a remap 
command from the configuration file, we unconditionally use 
the given mapping.

With L1/F2/F4, each pin may be individual remapped. Only for undefined 
pin we us the placement from a given remap command.

With no explicit remap, use the default placement.


In the config file, only the pin number is given. The C file will expand
the pin number for the known port. If a device uses the same pin number on
different port, prepend the higher ports with Portindex*100
