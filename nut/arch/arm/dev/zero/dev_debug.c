 * \brief Debug output device for Zero CPU.
 *
 * This code implements a polling UART driver for an imaginary CPU.
 * It may serve as a template when porting Nut/OS to a new target.
 * Implementers should look out for 'TODO' comments.
 *
 * We intentionally do not check, whether the parameters passed to
 * any function of this driver are valid, using NUTASSERT or similar.
 * There are two main reasons:
 * - The driver code is quite simple (and should be kept simple)
 * - If an error occurs, this debug device will be used to report it
 *
 * If you choose add more functions to this driver, avoid Nut/OS API
 * calls, or make sure, that these calls will not introduce a context
 * switch or allocate heap memory. The read function may be an exception,
 * if its use is limited to normal application context.

 * - concurrent threads are blocked during output
 * - most or all UART settings are hard coded
 * - may not work with non-ASCII (binary) data
