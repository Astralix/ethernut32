 * \brief Write formatted data to a string.
 *
 * This function is similar to \ref sprintf, but internally allocates
 * the required buffer using \ref malloc. If no longer used, the caller
 * must release this buffer by calling \ref free.
 *
 * \param strp Pointer to a character pointer that receives the address
 *             of a newly allocated output string.
 * \param fmt  Format string containing conversion specifications.
 * \param ...  List of arguments.
 *
 * \return The number of characters written. A negative value is
 *         returned to indicate an error. In this case no buffer
 *         is allocated and the pointer is set to NULL.
