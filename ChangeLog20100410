* Fixed:

Fixed SpiAt45dConfigWrite() for config space larger than one page      
The function is now able to write multiple pages and correctly 
handles a page offset

* Fixed:

TWI routines failed on AT91 targets. Fixed by Ulrich Prinz.

VS1053 now working with again out of the box with the old VS10XX driver, 
hopefully.

* Changed:

More targets supported with 'make burn' while using SAM-BA.

* Added:

New line editor with key mapping and history support.

Several enhancements to Lua scripting. All standard libraries are now 
available. I/O library supports TCP connect and accept. Lua default
libraries are selectable and configurable to use integers instead of
floating point. Lua stand-alone interpreter added, which even runs on 
8-bit targets, possibly the first one in the world.

* Fixed:

Added HW_EFC_AT91 config provision to AT91 members with embedded flash 
controller.

* Changed:

Starting a new ChangeLog. What do you think about it?

Provision HW_NVMEM renamed to DEV_NVMEM, because the driver, not the
hardware supports this.

Moved all non-volatile memory options to the to the target independant 
driver.

* Added:

Support for Ethernut 3.1, including SPI bus controller based on Nut 
Programmable Logic.

More detailed documentation to the non-volatile memory parts in the
configuration scripts.

        * Mark documented deprecated functions with NUT_DEPRECATE.
          This will cause warnings during compilation if deprecated functions
          are used in user code.
